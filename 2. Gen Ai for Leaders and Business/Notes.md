# Types of AI

- Machine Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning : Algo will find patterns in the data
    - Clustering
    - Dimension Reduction
  - Supervised Learning : Provide labeled data as input so algo can use as base
    - Regression
    - Classification
  - Reinforced Learning
    - Game
    - Skill acquisition
  - Deep Learning
    - NLP
    - Computer Vision
    - Neural Networks
    - Robotics
  - Generative AI : An advanced field of Maching Learning that can create unique composition based on input
    - GAN : Generative Adversary Networks
      - Has a generator and a checker that approves or declines the generated token, feedback will improve content and release when checker approves.
    - VAE : Variational AutoEncoder
      - Encode and Decode data
    - RNN : Recurrent Neural Network
      - Valuable to process sequential data where knowledge of past information is needed to understand the present
    - Tranformers : Can determine the significance of different passages in the input
      - Important parts receive extra attention from the AI

# Challenges

- Funding is often a barrier in AI implementation especially for start ups
- Lack of technical expertise: Invest in training for staff
- Ethical Issues and AI Bias
- Maintenance : Regular work is needed to ensure they function correctly, monitor and audit output and retrain when new data is available.
- Introduction of Bias via training on skewed data
